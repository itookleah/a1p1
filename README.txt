This program is a simple code that allows the user to view the files in a directory of their choosing along with a few additional commands. 
When the program is initially run the user is prompted to input commands or quit using 'Q'. 
Based on the commands that the user chooses and the directory that is chosen by the user, the code wil output the files/directories chosen. 
If the user wishes to view contents of a folder they must input a single line of code following the format of [COMMAND] [INPUT] [[-]OPTION] [INPUT]. 
For example, "L \ics32 -f" which will only view the files from the folder "ics32"but it will not output the directories/folders that are in ics32.
The current working commands on their own are L, C, D, R.
